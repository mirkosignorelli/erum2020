# List of e-Rum2020 resources

The goal of this folder is to collect a heterogeneous set of resources related to **e-Rum2020** (European R users meeting 2020) that is going to be held as virtual conference from June 17 to June 2020. I am mainly involved in the organization of this virtual conference as member of the [Organizing Committtee](https://2020.erum.io/about/organizers/); furthermore, on Friday 19 I will give a lightning talk about the R package ptmixed.

## Lightning talk about ptmixed

- Here is the deck of slides that I am going to present
- Here you can find the [preprint of the article about ptmixed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11193), which is in press with Statistical Modelling
