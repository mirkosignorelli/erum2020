# List of e-Rum2020 resources

The goal of this folder is to gather a heterogeneous set of resources related to **e-Rum2020** (European R users meeting 2020) that was held as virtual conference from June 17 to June 20, 2020. 

I was mainly involved in the organization of this virtual conference as member of the [Organizing Committtee](https://2020.erum.io/about/organizers/); furthermore, on Friday 19 I presented a lightning talk about the R package ptmixed.

## Lightning talk about ptmixed
