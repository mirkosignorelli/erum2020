# List of e-Rum2020 resources

The goal of this folder is to gather a heterogeneous set of resources related to **e-Rum2020** (European R users meeting 2020) that was held as virtual conference from June 17 to June 20, 2020. 

I was mainly involved in the organization of this virtual conference as member of the [Organizing Committtee](https://2020.erum.io/about/organizers/); furthermore, on Friday 19 I presented a lightning talk about the R package ptmixed.

## Lightning talk about ptmixed

- Here is the [deck of slides about ptmixed that I presented](https://github.com/m-signo/erum2020/blob/master/beamer-signorelli-erum2020.pdf) on Friday
- Here you can find the [preprint of the article about ptmixed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11193), which is in press with Statistical Modelling
- Finally, at this page you can [find out more about ptmixed and other R projects](https://mirkosignorelli.wixsite.com/home/software) that I have been working on over the last few years
